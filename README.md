* In our vision, a smart city is a place where people have all the tools they would need, in their hands
* In a smart city, people will be able to visit landmarks using only their mobile phones 
* The scope of our app is to automate the job of classic turist guides
* For this, Waddles should be able to: 
  * generate routes based on user's preferences
  * provide relevant information about any landmark (history/architecture/stories)
  * tracks user's location to entertain the user in any place
  * recognise a landmark, to make sure that the user visits what it's supposed to visit 
  * respond to user's questions
* Our MVP's features:
  * Users can create accounts and add preferences
  * User can prepare a trip schedule 
  * A schedule will be created based on user's preferences and city of choice. 
  * At this point we provide most visited landmarks from the city. 
  * The user can edit it's schedule (add/remove landmarks)
  * The user can decide to start it's jurney, then, the chatbot will start to talk to the user (provide basic stepts)
